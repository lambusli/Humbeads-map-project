# Humbead's Map and American Folk Music of 1960s

Humbeadâ€™s Revised Map reimagines the globe from the perspective of the American West Coast folk scene and emerging hippie counterculture. We attempted to recreate the map in a digital form and explore whether the digital map can add new aspects to the storytelling.
