/* Review */ 
Some basic file manipulations using Linux command
git add "filename" // . stands for all the files
git commit -m "message"
git status
git log -n "number"
git checkout "SHA" -- // Check out specific version

// Link online repo to local repo
git remote add orgin "url"

// ???
git remote -v

// Push local repo to online. Need to commit first
git push origin master

// Pull online repo to local 
git pull origin master

// Clone
git clone "url" "folder name"

// Merge conflict is caused by two people tries to push at the same time. The failed person has to pull the repo from online, fix the conflict, add & commit, and then pull. 
// Fix conflict when pulling
nano "filename"
// And then use the editor to flix the conflict
// And then perform add & recommit (message: merge conflict fixed)
